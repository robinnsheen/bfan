										<p>My name is Brian, and I am honored to run for First-Year Community and Inclusion Chair.</p>
										<p>In my short time at SOM, I have been deeply moved by our community’s commitment to
										celebrating every member. Our genuine desire to support one another is SOM’s greatest
										strength, and it must remain the driving force behind how we choose to be inclusive.</p>
										<p>Yet, the aspiration of “inclusion” often risks becoming performative: the mere act of bringing
										diverse people into the same room is not a replacement for meaningful engagement.
										Community does not emerge from proximity. I believe our responsibility at SOM is to go beyond
										presence, to nurture sustained and authentic expression, to be intentional and consistent about
										how we can uplift the voice of every member. One of my goals is to spark opportunities that will
										further enable the exchange of ideas and perspectives that extend beyond the implicit
										transactions of formal networking.</p>
										<p>While we all find comfort in the circles we naturally gravitate toward, we have to persist in
										seeking out the remarkable variety of experiences within SOM. These first weeks gave us a
										great foundation; looking forward, we should strengthen the norms we’ve built and find new
										ways to bring others into our spheres. Fostering those unexpected connections and amplifying
										niche interests is one of my top priorities.</p>
										<p>Above all, I hope to remain reflective by assessing whether our community truly exudes the
										values we claim. As we build our shared identity at SOM, I want to ensure that we continue to
										fiercely and freely celebrate our distinct journeys. SOM must remain a place where diversity of
										people and ideas are not only welcomed but actively invited.</p>
										
										
										<p>
										I am adamant that a strong community enriches all of our experiences. For me, sustaining that
										strength while seeing my peers flourish is more than a worthwhile endeavor, and I hope you’ll
										join me in shaping a more inclusive, connected SOM.

										<p>Prior to SOM, I developed policy on benefits administration for Trustees representing half a
											billion dollars in employee benefit funds. I engaged in outreach and retention programs for labor
											unions representing three hundred thousand workers in the building trades while standardizing
											workplace procedures and conducting compliance training for signatory employers. In addition, I
											served on an Amalgamated Transit Union task force to diversify recruitment for approximately
											two hundred thousand public transit workers in the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles
											metropolitan area.
